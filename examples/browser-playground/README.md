# Browser playground

## Usage steps
### 1
Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```
or
```bash
yarn
```

### 2
Save a file to get a uuid to be used in other examples
(You are here for the source code anyway, so don't hesitate to look though it, this example is pretty small anyway)

All methods will try to use uuid (second field in info section),
So make sure to copy one there from the logs
