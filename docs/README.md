Welcome to Casper API JS SDK wiki.

Casper API is a decentralized storage infrastructure.

This SDK allows you to store, modify, fetch and delete files on any casper network.
SDK is isomorphic, it means that it works in browser and nodejs environments almost identically.

Right now SDK will only connect to our [Parity](https://www.parity.io/) (private etherium testnet), as it provides sufficient performance. Later more blockchains will be supported.
